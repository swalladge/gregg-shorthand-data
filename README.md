# Shorthand data

Currently contains a dataset of Gregg Anniversary shorthand words with image
files for the forms.

Ported from the shorthand dictionary by @teddyyjc.


## Notes

- Discovered many duplicates during porting. For some duplicates, the forms are
  different images, but all still correct. For others, they include some errors.
  For example, 'department' has many duplicates. All are still correct forms,
  but it also includes the form for 'deportment'. 'deportment' is currently not
  in the dictionary. There are about 900 words with duplicates. :O (no work has
  been done yet to resolve duplicates)
